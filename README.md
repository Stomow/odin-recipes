# ODIN RECIPES

This is my first HTML assignment for the Odin Project, where I was tasked to make a website with no css at all and only raw html tags.
This website tells you how to create the following 3 seperate dishes.
1. Pizza
2. Mashed Potatoes
3. Cheesecake

All of these recipes have been generated from chatGPT (OpenAI).
