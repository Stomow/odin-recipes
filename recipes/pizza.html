    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Dough</li>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate the Yeast: In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and sprinkle<br>
                the yeast on top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.
            </li>
            <li>Mix the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 ½ cups flour and salt. Make <br>
                a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until the dough <br>
                begins to come together.
            </li>
            <li>Knead the Dough: Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about <br>
                8-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, gradually <br> add more flour.
            </li>
            <li>Let the Dough Rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean <br> 
                kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until it doubles<br>
                in size.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce</li>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the Sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat a bit of olive oil over medium heat. 
                <br>Add minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>Simmer the Sauce: Add the tomato sauce, oregano, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper. 
                <br>Simmer on low heat for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasoning to taste.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <li>Assemble the Pizza</li>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, <br>
                place it in the oven while preheating.
            </li>
            <li>Roll Out the Dough: Punch down the dough and divide it into two portions <br>
                (for two pizzas). Roll each portion out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the Pizza Base: Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet <br>
                lined with parchment paper. Brush the edges of the dough with olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>Add the Sauce and Toppings: Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough,<br>
                leaving a border for the crust. Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese and add your <br>
                desired toppings.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <li>Bake the Pizza</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Bake the Pizza: Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the <br>
                baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the <br>
                cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
            </li>
            <li>Cool and Garnish: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of<br> 
                minutes. Garnish with fresh basil or other herbs if desired.
            </li>
        </ol>
