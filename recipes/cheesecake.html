            <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Cheesecake Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2/3 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare Crust</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).</li>
                <li>Make the Crust: In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs, ¼ cup sugar, and melted butter until well combined.</li>
                <li>Press the Crust: Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Use the bottom of a flat <br> 
                    glass or measuring cup to press it firmly.
                </li>
                <li>Bake the Crust: Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. After baking, remove from the oven and allow it to cool while <br>
                     preparing the filling.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li>Make the Cheesecake Filling</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat the Cream Cheese: In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy.</li>
                <li>Add Sugar and Vanilla: Gradually add the 1 cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Continue to beat until well combined.</li>
                <li>Add Eggs: Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Make sure the mixture is smooth and lump-free.</li>
                <li>Add Sour Cream and Heavy Cream: Mix in the sour cream and heavy cream, beating until smooth.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li>Assemble and Bake</li>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour the Filling: Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan.</li>
                <li>Prepare a Water Bath: Wrap the bottom of the springform pan in aluminum foil to prevent water from leaking in. <br>
                    Place the pan in a larger baking dish or roasting pan. Pour hot water into the larger pan until it reaches halfway <br>
                    up the sides of the springform pan. This water bath helps to prevent cracks in the cheesecake.</li>
                <li>Bake the Cheesecake: Carefully transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 55-70 minutes, or until the center is <br>
                    set but still slightly jiggly.</li>
                <li>Cool the Cheesecake: Once baked, turn off the oven and crack the oven door slightly. Allow the cheesecake to <br>
                    cool in the oven for 1 hour. This gradual cooling helps prevent cracks.</li>          
                <li>Chill: After cooling, cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li> 
            </ol>
