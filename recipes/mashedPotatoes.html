        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds (about 1 kg) potatoes (Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes work best)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup whole milk or heavy cream (adjust according to preference)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Optional: Garlic, herbs (like chives or parsley), sour cream, or cream cheese <br>
                for extra flavor
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Potatoes</li>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the Potatoes: Peel the potatoes using a vegetable peeler. If you prefer <br>
                    a rustic mash with some texture, you can leave the skins on.</li>
                <li>Cut the Potatoes: Cut the potatoes into evenly sized chunks, about 1-2 inches. <br> This helps them cook evenly.</li>
                <li>Rinse the Potatoes: Rinse the potato chunks under cold water to remove excess starch.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li>Cook the Potatoes</li>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the Potatoes: Place the potato chunks in a large pot and cover them with cold <br> water. Add a generous pinch of salt to the water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat</li>
                <li>Cook Until Tender: Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the potatoes for 15-20 minutes, <br>or until they are tender and easily pierced with a fork.</li>
                <li>Drain the Potatoes: Once cooked, drain the potatoes in a colander. Let them sit for a minute <br>to steam off any excess water.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li>Mash the Potatoes</li>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the Milk/Butter: While the potatoes are draining, heat the milk (or cream) and butter in a <br>small saucepan until the butter is melted and the mixture is warm. This helps keep the potatoes <br> warm and makes them creamier.</li>
                <li>Mash the Potatoes: Return the drained potatoes to the pot or a large mixing bowl. Use a potato masher, <br> ricer, or even a fork to mash the potatoes to your desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Add the Milk/Butter Mixture: Gradually add the warm milk and butter mixture to the mashed potatoes, stirring <br> as you go. Continue to mash until the potatoes are smooth and creamy. Add more milk or cream if you prefer a <br> looser consistency.</li>
                <li>Season to Taste: Season the mashed potatoes with salt and black pepper to taste. Stir well to combine.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li>Add Optional Ingredients</li>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Garlic: For garlic mashed potatoes, add roasted or sautéed garlic during the mashing process.</li>
                <li>Herbs: Stir in fresh chopped herbs like chives, parsley, or thyme for added flavor.</li>
                <li>Creamy Additions: You can also add sour cream, cream cheese, or even a bit of grated cheese <br> for extra richness and flavor.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><h3>Enjoy!</h3></li>
